//Object-Oriented Programming.

/* 
Advantages of OOPs:
    - Fast & easy to execute → Easier debugging and modularity.
    - Reusability → Code can be reused using inheritance.
    - Data security → Achieved through encapsulation.
    - Clear structure → Code is well organized.
    - DRY principle → Avoids repetition.


Classes and Objects:
    - Class is a blueprint/template of an object.
    - Object is an instance of a class.
    - Object inherit all variables and methods from class.
